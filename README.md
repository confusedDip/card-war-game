# War Card Game

This is a simple iOS Application made using SwiftUI that randomly generates two cards for the player and the CPU.
Whoever has a higher card, gets 1 point, and once either player or the CPU reaches 10 points, the game resets.

Here are a few screenshots of the game:

<div style="display:flex;">

</div>
